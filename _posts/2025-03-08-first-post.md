I decided I wanted to add more creativity into my life, and start blogging. It's not something I've ever managed to do with any real consistency before, but I am (perhaps unjustifiably) optimistic!

I initially thought that this would primarily be about coding and any side projects that I make progress with. But the more I've thought about it, the more I want it to be a collection of ramblings on all the other things that interest me as well. The result will probably be a hodge-podge of random bits and pieces, that may be of little interest to anyone else. But I think writing about things that I like, or want to remember, will make it more likely that I actually keep this up semi-regularly, than trying to write for an imaginary audience that may never find me.

I will try to be meticulous and consistent with my categories and tags, so it will hopefully be easy to find the type of content that interests you. The length of post will probably vary wildly, but my main aim will be consistency and regular posts.

Topics that I think I'll be writing about are: web-development (primarily Rails), boardgames (probably mostly from a solo angle), food and cooking, books (probably fairly short reviews) and all of the above and anything else I fancy through the lens of being a 40-something autistic woman.

Thanks for dropping by, I hope you find something of interest!
