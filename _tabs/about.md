My name is Sarah, and I have over ten years experience in web development, after changing careers via bootcamp. In a previous life I trained as an animator, and in a life previous to that, I worked in publishing.

I enjoy playing boardgames, reading, watching TV, cooking and hanging out with my dog and partner.
